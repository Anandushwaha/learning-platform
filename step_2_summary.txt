# Step 2: User Role Management - Implementation Summary

## What We Implemented

1. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - User model with `role` field (student or instructor)
   - Middleware for protecting routes based on user roles
   - Backend routes with appropriate role-based restrictions

2. **Role-Specific Dashboards**
   - Student dashboard with specific UI and data
   - Teacher dashboard with specific UI and data
   - Automatic redirection based on user role

3. **Frontend Routing**
   - Dynamic routing that respects user roles
   - Protected routes that verify both authentication and authorization
   - Redirect component to guide users to appropriate dashboard

## Key Changes

### Backend Changes

1. **Routes**
   - Created `/api/students/dashboard` endpoint (student-only access)
   - Created `/api/teachers/dashboard` endpoint (teacher-only access)
   - Protected these routes with role-based middleware

2. **Middleware**
   - Leveraged the existing `authorize` middleware to restrict routes by role
   - Ensured proper error responses for unauthorized access

### Frontend Changes

1. **Components**
   - Created separate `StudentDashboard.jsx` component
   - Created separate `TeacherDashboard.jsx` component
   - Added role-specific UI elements and data display

2. **Authentication Context**
   - Updated `redirectBasedOnRole` function to route users correctly
   - Enhanced login/register functionality to respect user roles
   - Improved token handling for protected routes

3. **Routing**
   - Modified `App.jsx` to include role-specific routes
   - Created `RoleBasedRedirect` component for dynamic redirection
   - Added proper protection to routes with role checks

## How It Works

1. **Registration Flow**
   - User selects role (student or instructor) during registration
   - Backend validates and stores role in user document
   - JWT token includes role information

2. **Login Flow**
   - Upon login, user role is retrieved from database
   - Frontend redirects to appropriate dashboard based on role
   - Role information is stored in authentication context

3. **Dashboard Access**
   - Students can only access student dashboard
   - Teachers can only access teacher dashboard
   - Attempts to access unauthorized areas are blocked

4. **Route Protection**
   - Backend middleware checks token validity and role
   - Frontend routing respects role-based restrictions
   - Unauthorized access attempts redirect to error page
