# Manual Instructions for Running the Online Learning Platform

## Running the Backend

1. Open PowerShell
2. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd D:\anand\online-learning-platform\online-learning-platform\backend
   ```
3. Start the backend server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Running the Frontend

1. Open a new PowerShell window
2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd D:\anand\online-learning-platform\online-learning-platform\frontend
   ```
3. Start the frontend server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you get an error like "Token '&&' is not a valid statement separator":
- Don't use '&&' in PowerShell, run commands separately.

If you get "package.json not found" errors:
- Make sure you're in the correct directory as shown above.

If you get JWT errors:
- Ensure your .env file in the backend directory has all required variables.
- You might need to clear your browser cookies and localStorage.
