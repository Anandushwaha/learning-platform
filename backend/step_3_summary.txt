# Course Management System Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

1. **Course Management System**
   - Course Model with fields: title, className, division, teacherId, studentsEnrolled, createdAt
   - API endpoints for teachers to create, view, update, and delete courses
   - API endpoints for students to view available courses and enroll in them
   - Role-based authorization to ensure proper access control

## Models

### Course Model
- **Fields**:
  - `title`: Course title (required)
  - `className`: Class name (required)
  - `division`: Class division (required)
  - `teacherId`: Reference to the teacher who created the course (required)
  - `studentsEnrolled`: Array of student IDs enrolled in the course
  - `description`: Optional course description
  - `status`: Course status (active, inactive, archived)
  - `createdAt`: Automatically generated timestamp

## API Endpoints

### Teacher Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/courses/create`: Create a new course
- `GET /api/v1/courses/teacher`: Get all courses created by the logged-in teacher
- `PUT /api/v1/courses/:id`: Update a specific course (only if created by the logged-in teacher)
- `DELETE /api/v1/courses/:id`: Delete a specific course (only if created by the logged-in teacher)

### Student Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/courses`: View all available courses
- `POST /api/v1/courses/enroll/:id`: Enroll in a specific course
- `GET /api/v1/courses/student/enrolled`: View all courses the student is enrolled in

## Authorization & Access Control Implementation

1. **Middleware**:
   - `protect`: Ensures the user is authenticated before accessing any course routes
   - `authorize`: Restricts access based on user role (teacher or student)

2. **Course Ownership**:
   - Teachers can only modify (update/delete) courses they have created
   - The controller checks if the course's teacherId matches the logged-in user's ID

3. **Role-Based Access**:
   - Only teachers can create, update, or delete courses
   - Only students can enroll in courses
   - Both teachers and students can view course listings

## How It Works

1. **Teacher Course Management**:
   - Teachers create courses with title, className, and division
   - They can view all courses they've created
   - They can update or delete only the courses they've created

2. **Student Course Enrollment**:
   - Students can view all available courses
   - They can enroll in any course
   - They can view a list of courses they're enrolled in
   - The system prevents duplicate enrollments

## Key Notes

1. **Data Integrity**:
   - Course model has validation to ensure required fields are provided
   - Controllers include error handling for all operations

2. **Security**:
   - All routes require authentication
   - Role-based authorization prevents unauthorized actions
   - Course ownership verification prevents teachers from modifying other teachers' courses

3. **Testing**:
   - API endpoints can be tested using the provided Postman documentation
   - Authorization tests ensure the role-based access control is working properly
